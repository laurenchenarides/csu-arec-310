-   What is Justice40? And what investments are included?\
-   What are the typical energy injustice and how to address them?\
-   What are the drivers of energy transition?\

## Energy poverty and gender equity

- Women and kids spend more time collecting wood fuel    
- Women spend more time on cooking without clean fuel/energy  
- Women bear more burden on indoor air pollution  
- Women have less oportunity for development

## Energy justice

> The goal of achieving equity in both the social and economic participation in the energy system, while also remediating social, economic, and health burdens on those disproportionately harmed by the energy system.

## Energy, environmental, climate justice

| Energy               | Environmental               | Climate                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Energy supply/demand | Environment burden/benefits | Climate impact/benefits |

**Common Questions**:  
Who bears the burden? Who harvests the benefits? Do we know the injustice? Can people involve in the decision proceses? How to compensate?

## Drivers of energy transition

- Demand
- Supply
- Climate change
- Environmental pollution
- Energy security
- Economics


## 100% reneables: a debate

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
100% renewables (wind, water, solar) for all purposes?

- Resources, technology, economic ready  
- Huge benefits

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
100% renewable not viable/necesssary?

- Modeling errors   
- Implausible assumptions  
- Need better modeling

Energy transition is difficult, broad technology portfolio is needed

## Energy Transition: The German Energiewende

- Fighting climate change
- Reducing energy imports
- Stimulating technology innovation and the green economy
- Reducing and eliminating the risks of nuclear power
- Energy security
- Strengthening local economies and providing social justice

## China: Fewer than 15% of coal power workers transition to green jobs

![](/images/china-coal-power-green-jobs.jpg){fig-align="center"}

:::{style="font-size:24px"}
- A coal power worker needs to travel 194 (178–242) km on average to access a green job.  
- Only 11%–14% of existing coal power workers will transition to green jobs by 2060.
