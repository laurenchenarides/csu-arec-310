Rams take care of Rams. Reach out and ask for help if you or someone you know is having a difficult time.\n\n\nSexual Assault and Violence Elimination\nCSU‚Äôs Student Sexual Harassment and Violence policy, following national guidance from the Office of Civil Rights, requires that professors follow CSU policy as a ‚Äúmandatory reporter‚Äù of any personal disclosure of sexual harassment, abuse, and/or violence related experiences or incidents shared with the professor in person, via email, and/or in classroom papers or homework exercises. These disclosures include but are not limited to reports of personal relational abuse, relational/domestic violence, and stalking. While professors are often able to help students locate appropriate channels of assistance on campus (e.g., see the CSU Health Network link below), disclosure by the student to the professor requires that the professor inform appropriate CSU channels to help ensure that the student‚Äôs safety and welfare is being addressed, even if the student requests that the disclosure not be shared.\nFor counseling support and assistance, please see The CSU HEALTH NETWORK, which includes a variety of counseling services that can be accessed at: http://www.health.colostate.edu/. And, The Sexual Assault Victim Assistance Team is a confidential resource for students that does not have a reporting requirement and that can be of great help to students who have experienced sexual assault.

Any student found responsible for having engaged in academic misconduct will be subject to academic penalty and/or University disciplinary action.\nStudents are encouraged to positively impact the academic integrity culture of CSU by reporting incidents of academic misconduct.\nExamples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to):\n\nCheating ‚Äì Cheating includes using unauthorized sources of information and providing or receiving unauthorized assistance on any form of academic work or engaging in any behavior specifically prohibited by the instructor in the course syllabus or class presentation.\nPlagiarism ‚Äì Plagiarism includes the copying of language, structure, images, ideas, or thoughts of another, and representing them as one‚Äôs own without proper acknowledgment, and is related only to work submitted for credit.

However, if you choose to use such tools, you are claiming the resulting work as your own, and you bear full responsibility for its accuracy and appropriateness. In your assignments, you must disclose if AI tools were used and how. Doing so may not harm your grade; rather, it helps me guide you in using these tools effectively to enhance your grasp of the material.

    "text": "Water withdrawal vs.¬†water consumption\n\nWithdrawal is the volume of water removed from a source\n\nConsumption is the volume of water withdrawn that is not returned to the source, i.e.¬†it is evaporated or transported to another location.¬†\nDischarge is the volume of water withdrawn that is returned to the source, often degraded by use (altered physically or chemically) and impacting water quality.¬†\nWater withdrawals are, by definition, always greater than or equal to consumption and are, therefore, the first limit approached at an energy production facility when water availability is constrained.¬†\nConsumptive use reduces the amount of water available to satisfy demands downstream and is an important consideration where water resources are strained to meet the needs of all users."

Whether you launch your own venture or work within an existing organization, entrepreneurship is about solving problems, creating value, and navigating uncertainty with creativity and resourcefulness.\nWe‚Äôll explore both entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship‚Äîwhat it looks like to lead innovation from inside a company, nonprofit, or public agency. These skills are relevant no matter where your career takes you.\n\nOur Learning Culture\nI want you to imagine we‚Äôre all part of the same organization‚Äîone where everyone‚Äôs success depends on how well we collaborate, share ideas, and support each other‚Äôs growth. That means:\n\nWe take initiative and hold ourselves accountable.\nWe celebrate experimentation and embrace failure as part of the process.\nWe give and receive feedback with curiosity and respect.\nWe build a culture that reflects the kind of teams we‚Äôd want to work on in the real world.\n\nMy goal is to help you connect what you‚Äôre learning to real decisions and real contexts. By the end of the course, you‚Äôll have experience identifying problems, framing solutions, testing ideas, and communicating your value‚Äîskills you can carry into any industry or role.\nLet‚Äôs build something meaningful together.\n\n\n\n\nImage quote: ‚ÄúThe best way to predict the future is to invent it.‚Äù\n\n\nAlthough this quote is often attributed to Peter Drucker‚Äîand occasionally to Abraham Lincoln‚Äîthere is no reliable evidence linking it to either. The earliest known use is from Dennis Gabor‚Äôs 1963 book Inventing the Future, and it was later popularized by Alan Kay.\nQuote Investigator"

A first-generation farmer, she entered the field during a wave of small farm resurgence, piecing together knowledge through experiential learning and courses like those from Floret and Neversink Farm. Her parents worked in government and public service, but Helen found her calling in flowers and sustainable agriculture.\nCurrent Ventures: Helen runs Artemis Flower Farm near Niwot, CO (since 2014), specializing in sustainably grown cut flowers. She sells flowers through wholesale to florists, a regional flower aggregator, farmers markets, on-farm workshops, and wedding floral design. In 2021, she joined the Treehouse Farm Collective, where she shares land with vegetable farmers and a vermicomposting operation, among others. She grows on about 2.5 acres and produced over 175,000 stems of more than 80 varieties of flowers in 2024.\nExpertise: Specialty cut flower production, direct marketing, sustainable small-scale farming, employee and labor management, on-farm events and education, and collective organizing. Helen is also a regional director on the board of the Association of Specialty Cut Flower Growers, where she helps organize farm tours and conferences.\nStudent Experience: Students working with Helen may visit her farms during the growing season and see how flower farming is managed from the ground up‚Äîfrom soil prep to sales. She‚Äôs passionate about sharing the realities of small-scale farming and may involve students in farm tours, on-farm workshops (like her‚ÄùFlower Happy Hour‚Äù events), and broader industry connections through networks like the Flatirons Farmers Coalition.\nFun Fact: Helen enjoys growing and crafting with hard-shelled gourds."

While he wasn‚Äôt a DARE major, he took courses in the program and credits those experiences with shaping his entrepreneurial mindset. During college and immediately after college, he worked for Monsanto and went on to spend 4 years as a District Sales Manager, supporting sales growth and dealer development across Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Kansas and Nebraska.\nCurrent Ventures: Tim is a service-driven entrepreneur who most recently served as President and Partner of Palmer Flowers Companies, an employee owned retail florist group in Northern Colorado for 10 years. He and his wife sold the business in 2024 after nearly a decade of growth and industry leadership as the largest retail florist in Colorado. Tim also previously founded Mold Removal Express in 2012 and acquired SG Window Tint via acquisition in 2010. Tim currently operates those ventures and is actively seeking other investments in the form of small and medium sized service businesses.\nExpertise: Sales strategy, business development, small business operations, identifying and evaluating market opportunities, process development and implementation and growing customer-facing service businesses.\nStudent Experience: Tim is eager to take students behind the scenes of former ventures like Palmer Flowers and share what he‚Äôs learned from building and selling service-based businesses. Students will gain exposure to sales, entrepreneurship, and the mindset behind spotting market gaps and turning them into viable enterprises.\nFun Fact: Tim is a sports and activity nut. He just recently completed a 112 mile bike ride in South Dakota (The George Mickelson Trail), plays volleyball, softball and pickleball often. In his downtime, he enjoys all things Colorado sports has to offer."
