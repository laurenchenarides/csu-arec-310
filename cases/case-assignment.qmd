Each student will participate in:

- **One Fishbowl** team: youâ€™ll lead the case discussion for a specific case study
- **One Observer** team: the week after your Fishbowl discussion, youâ€™ll observe and reflect on the next teamâ€™s discussion

All students, *except the fishbowl team*, submit a **pre-class reflection** every week.

You only need to sign up for **one Fishbowl week**â€”your Observer role will be assigned based on that.

[See Role Expectations](case-roles.qmd)
