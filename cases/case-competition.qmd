## Overview

This is not a Shark Tank-style pitch. Instead, you'll develop a business case grounded in your mentor’s entrepreneurial experience.

Your goal is to present a real-world decision or dilemma they’ve faced—or one they could realistically face—framed in a way that invites critical thinking and discussion, much like the case studies we’ve covered throughout the semester. The emphasis is on clarity, depth, and relevance.

At the center of your case is a guiding question:

**What should the entrepreneur do next—and why?**

You’re not being asked to provide the final answer. Instead, your job is to build a thoughtful, well-researched case that helps others understand the decision context and weigh the tradeoffs.

## Team Structure

At the start of the course, you were matched with a mentor and placed into a pod. Your **case competition team will be the same as your podcast pod**. You’ll work with this group throughout the semester—interviewing your mentor, learning about their entrepreneurial journey, and building a business case inspired by it.

Your task now is to develop a case rooted in your mentor’s real-life experience—a decision they’ve faced (or could realistically face)—and extend it with original research, thoughtful analysis, and creative framing.

Just like the cases we've studied, your business case should raise a meaningful dilemma and present enough context for others to discuss and engage with it critically.

## Deliverables

Each team will turn in **three items** as part of your final case competition. These should be polished, clear, and based on your mentor’s real-world experience.

| Deliverable                  | What It Is                                           | What to Focus On                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Written Case (4–6 pages)**| A short case study modeled after the ones we’ve read.| Provide background on your mentor and their business, describe a real decision they faced (or could face), and set up a dilemma with no “right” answer. End with 2–3 guiding questions. Do **not** include a solution. |
| **Live Presentation (8–10 min)** | A team presentation delivered during our final session. | Present your case in a way that brings it to life. Walk us through the situation, what’s at stake, and why it matters. Focus on clear storytelling—not on pitching your own idea. |
| **Slide Deck**              | Visual support for your live presentation.           | Keep slides simple and focused. Use them to support your story—not distract from it. You can include visuals, charts, or key facts. Avoid putting too much text on slides. |

All materials will be submitted via Canvas. Aim for a tone that’s professional but approachable. You’re telling a real story that should spark discussion, not solving it for your audience.

## Structure of the Written Case

Use the following structure as a guide:

1. **Title**  
   A compelling and relevant title that hints at the decision/dilemma.

2. **Opening Hook**  
   Start in the middle of the action—a quote, moment, or decision point.

3. **Background**  
   Provide context on the business, mentor, and market environment.

4. **The Challenge**  
   What dilemma or opportunity are they facing? What’s at stake?

5. **Data and Decision Factors**  
   Include relevant information the reader needs to consider (e.g., customer data, financials, trends).

6. **Guiding Questions**  
   2–4 questions to guide discussion. (E.g., "Should they expand into wholesale?" "How can they balance mission with growth?")
