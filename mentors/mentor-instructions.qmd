## Welcome, Mentors

Thank you for serving as a mentor in *Introduction to Agribusiness Entrepreneurship*! This course would not be what it is without your time, experience, and presence. You’ll help students gain real-world insight into entrepreneurship by sharing your story, offering feedback, and encouraging their growth.

This guide outlines your role, the timeline, and how to prepare.

## Your Role

You’ll be paired with a small group of students (a "pod" of four students) who will:

- Interview you in a student-produced podcast (recorded on campus)
- Prepare a business case concept based on your story
- Present the business case concept at the end-of-semester competition <br>
  *Think of this as a "story-telling" event about your entrepreneurial journey—framed around a real dilemma or decision point that students explored and built into a formal case study).*


## Time Commitment

As a mentor, we ask that you engage with your student pod at four key points during the semester:

(1) Introductory Meeting (Weeks 2–3) <br>
  A casual 30–45 minute meeting to get to know your pod, share your background, and hear about students' interests.

(2) Podcast Interview (Weeks 4–6) <br>
  Join your pod in a 30–40 minute recorded interview at CSU’s podcast studio. We’ll provide sample questions and handle logistics.

(3) Pod Check-ins (Mid-semester and pre-finals) <br>
  Meet with your pod twice more—once mid-semester and again before the final presentation. Each check-in is 30–45 minutes and can be virtual or in person.

(4) Final Case Competition & Networking Event (Week 16) <br>
  Attend our two-hour end-of-semester event where students present their business cases inspired by your story. Enjoy light refreshments and connect with other mentors, students, and faculty.
  
We also welcome additional engagement if your schedule allows—this could include site visits, virtual Q&A, or informal chats. If you're open to hosting a visit (by your pod or even the full class), please let us know and we’ll help coordinate.

## Timeline of Activities

The course runs from **August 25 to December 14, 2025**, and follows a weekly schedule. Weeks are numbered based on the academic calendar. You can refer to the [Course Schedule](../2025/schedule.qmd) for specific dates associated with each week.

The table below outlines major milestones involving mentor-student engagement, along with expectations for both mentors and students.

| Week | Activity | Mentor Action | Student Role |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1    | Course Launch | – | Students begin learning about case studies, podcasting, and interviewing |
| 2    | Initial Contact | Respond to students' outreach and confirm an intro meeting time | Initiate contact with mentor and schedule an intro meeting (virtual or in-person) |
| 3–4  | First Pod Meeting | Join 30–45 min check-in; share background and answer questions | Conduct first pod meeting; prepare questions and document key insights |
| 4–6  | Podcast Interview | Attend a 30–40 min recorded podcast session at CSU studio | Host and produce podcast episode featuring mentor’s story |
| 8    | Mid-Semester Feedback | Submit short feedback form for each student in your pod | Receive and reflect on mentor feedback for E-IDP refinement |
| 12–13 | Second Pod Meeting | Join second 30–45 min check-in; provide guidance on business case direction | Present progress on business concept and solicit mentor input |
| 16   | Final Competition | Attend and watch student presentations; submit final feedback form | Present final business case inspired by mentor story |


We’ll coordinate scheduling via email and provide reminders.



## Preparing for Your Interview

The podcast interview will be student-led and conversational. You don’t need to prepare a script, but here are suggested prompts they may explore:

- What problem did you set out to solve?
- What was your “aha” moment—or was it gradual?
- What challenges did you face early on?
- What business model did you choose and why?
- How did you define success?
- What advice would you give your younger self?
- How do you see your business evolving?

You’re welcome to share lessons, numbers, pivots, and surprises—anything that brings your story to life.



## Supporting Your Pod

After your introductory meeting, you’ll meet your student group twice—once mid-semester and once as they prepare for final case presentations. These are informal 30–45 minute virtual or in-person sessions.

Students may ask for your perspective on:

- Customer needs
- Market trends
- Growth strategies
- Communication and branding
- Your feedback on their evolving business idea

You don’t need to “grade” anything—your role is to guide, challenge, and encourage.

### Guiding Student Growth: Your Role in the "E-IDP"

Each student is building an [**Entrepreneurial Individual Development Plan (E-IDP)**](eidp.qmd) throughout the semester. This plan helps them reflect on and strengthen key entrepreneurial skills—ranging from creativity and persistence to opportunity recognition and team leadership.

At **Week 7**, we’ll ask you to submit a short feedback form (3 questions) based on your interactions so far. This is not an evaluation—it’s a chance to offer encouragement and suggestions for growth. We’ll ask for a second round of feedback after the final case presentations in **Week 16**.

Your perspective helps make this learning experience more real and more personal for each student.

## Final Case Competition

At the end of the semester, students will present their business concepts (inspired by your story) in a class-wide competition. You’ll be invited to attend as a guest and cheer them on.
