## What Is the E-IDP?

The Entrepreneurial Individual Development Plan (E-IDP) is a professional growth tool youâ€™ll use throughout this course. Think of it like a workplace development plan: youâ€™ll identify a few key areas to focus on, set goals, and track your progress with input from a mentor.

Entrepreneurship isnâ€™t just about launching a businessâ€”itâ€™s about developing a mindset and skillset that can be applied in any career. The E-IDP gives you space to:

You will use the E-IDP to:

- Reflect on your entrepreneurial strengths and growth areas
- Track your development throughout the semester
- Receive feedback from your mentor based on real-world interaction
- Notice patterns in how you work and learn

Your mentor will also use the E-IDP to support your developmentb by giving you feedback on your development mid-semester and at the end of the semester. Youâ€™ll each be working from the same set of 42 entrepreneurial characteristics (listed below).

ðŸ‘‰ [View Mentor Instructions](mentor-instructions.qmd) to understand what they'll see.

## Instructions: How to use the E-IDP

Youâ€™ll focus on just **three** characteristics that feel meaningful or relevant to you right now. Youâ€™ll return to these throughout the semester:

| Week | What You'll Do         |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 1  | Choose 3 characteristics. Complete your baseline self-assessment **in Canvas** and explain why you chose them. |
| 8  | Your mentor will complete a brief check-in assessment on your progress. Youâ€™ll review their feedback and update your E-IDP. |
| 15  | Complete a final self-assessment and write a short reflection on how youâ€™ve grown. |

You donâ€™t need to be "good" at something to choose it. You might pick something you want to strengthen or explore. The goal is clarity and growthâ€”not perfection.
