**Background:** Originally from Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, Bobby grew up on an Angus cow-calf operation and developed a passion for livestock early on. He began college at Hutchinson Community College, where he competed on the livestock judging team and was active in Collegiate Farm Bureau, before transferring to CSU and graduating in Spring 2015. He later returned to Hutch as a livestock judging coach.

**Current Ventures:**  Bobby is now the Sales Team Leader for [ABS Global](https://www.absglobal.com/) across Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. He manages a team of 28 and works closely with producers on genetics, reproduction strategies, and bull acquisitions. His work is highly seasonal—ranging from marketing and social media content to spring sales and winter consulting. He and his wife, an agriculture teacher in Holyoke, also run a diversified livestock operation at home and a growing show goat business that now reaches into Oklahoma and Texas using AI technologies.

**Expertise:** Livestock genetics, team management, reproduction consulting, bull marketing, entrepreneurship in animal agriculture, and youth livestock development. Bobby is especially skilled in leading teams, navigating different personalities, and building long-term relationships with producers.

**Student Experience:** Students working with Bobby will see the business side of livestock—from genetic sales and bull write-ups to customer consulting and starting a show goat operation from scratch. He emphasizes listening, patience, and steady leadership, and is open to sharing lessons on both the technical and human sides of ag entrepreneurship.

**Fun Fact:** When he’s not traveling for work or managing his operation, Bobby occasionally judges livestock shows. He and his wife are raising two young kids in Holyoke, Colorado.
