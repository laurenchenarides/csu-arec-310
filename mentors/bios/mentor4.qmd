**Background:** John is a former CSU tight end who graduated in 2004 with a degree in Animal Science. He describes himself as someone who didn’t thrive in the classroom, but loved college and credits his advisor, Tom Fields, for supporting his path. He grew up on a family onion farm in Fort Morgan and began his career in produce brokerage shortly after graduation.

**Current Ventures:** John is the founder of [Paradigm Fresh](https://paradigmfresh.com/), a produce distribution company focused on wholesale and retail fresh fruits and vegetables, and services Target’s nine regional distribution centers with onions. In 2015, he expanded his operations with [Colorado Cold Connect](https://coloradocoldconnect.com/), a separate cold storage and logistics business that now serves clients like Noosa Yogurt. His companies include a Fort Morgan warehouse and a 150,000 sq. ft. freezer facility with expansion possibilities to reach up to 300,000 sq. ft., supported by a regional fleet of 9 trucks and 40 refrigerated trailers.

**Expertise:** Perishable supply chains, cold storage logistics, produce marketing, operations management, and food brokerage. John is especially passionate about team culture and leadership—he runs his companies with a roundtable philosophy where everyone is a spoke in the wheel.

**Student Experience:** Students working with John will gain insight into how fresh food moves from farm to shelf, including the behind-the-scenes logistics that power retail supply chains. He offers a unique perspective on scaling a business, developing infrastructure, and building strong, values-driven teams in a fast-paced industry.

**Fun Fact:** John is a scratch golfer and a two-time Ironman Finisher.
