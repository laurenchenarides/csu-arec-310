**Background:** Tim graduated cum laude from CSU in 2010 with a degree in Finance. While he wasn’t a DARE major, he took courses in the program and credits those experiences with shaping his entrepreneurial mindset. During college and immediately after college, he worked for Monsanto and went on to spend 4 years as a District Sales Manager, supporting sales growth and dealer development across Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Kansas and Nebraska.

**Current Ventures:** Tim is a service-driven entrepreneur who most recently served as President and Partner of [Palmer Flowers Companies](https://www.palmerflowers.com/about-us), an employee owned retail florist group in Northern Colorado for 10 years. He and his wife sold the business in 2024 after nearly a decade of growth and industry leadership as the largest retail florist in Colorado. Tim also previously founded [Mold Removal Express](https://www.moldremovalexpress.com/) in 2012 and acquired [SG Window Tint](https://www.sgwindowtint.com/fort-collins/window-tinting-services/auto-tint-service/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22081491111&gbraid=0AAAAADllv2N1pq0uU0_yep83yzQUu2Va6&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmqPDBhCAARIsADorxIY8rJNqNwlTO-ec3dwkAo9fjD_lGsX_KVzxKVUi6nE4aujEZNhxL0oaAhlWEALw_wcB) via acquisition in 2010. Tim currently operates those ventures and is actively seeking other investments in the form of small and medium sized service businesses.

**Expertise:** Sales strategy, business development, small business operations, identifying and evaluating market opportunities, process development and implementation and growing customer-facing service businesses.

**Student Experience:** Tim is eager to take students behind the scenes of former ventures like Palmer Flowers and share what he’s learned from building and selling service-based businesses. Students will gain exposure to sales, entrepreneurship, and the mindset behind spotting market gaps and turning them into viable enterprises.

**Fun Fact:** Tim is a sports and activity nut. He just recently completed a 112 mile bike ride in South Dakota (The George Mickelson Trail), plays volleyball, softball and pickleball often. In his downtime, he enjoys all things Colorado sports has to offer.
