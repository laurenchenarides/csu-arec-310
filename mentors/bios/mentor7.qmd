**Background:** Jordan graduated cum laude from Babson College in 1998 with a degree in Finance and Economics and completed the General Course at the London School of Economics. He began his career in commodity trading at Framework Investment Group, managing grain and livestock operations for a $1 billion fund. That experience sparked a lifelong career at the intersection of agriculture, finance, and entrepreneurship.

**Current Ventures:** Jordan is the founder and CEO of [Arcadia Asset Management](https://www.acadian-asset.com/), which manages a physical livestock fund for institutional clients. In 2018, Arcadia and its partners acquired [Five Rivers Cattle Feeding](https://www.fiveriverscattle.com/), the world’s largest cattle feeding operation. He also founded the Fed Cattle Exchange, an online trading platform. Jordan serves on the board of Five Rivers’ holding company and holds advisory roles with CattleFax, Rabo AgriFinance, and the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. He’s also adjunct faculty at CSU and an active member of CSU’s AgIndustry Leadership Council.

**Expertise:** Cattle markets, commodity trading, livestock production, fund management, and ag entrepreneurship. Jordan brings unique insight into how capital flows shape food production systems.

**Student Experience:** Students working with Jordan will learn about commodity markets, large-scale cattle operations, and the strategic thinking behind ag-sector innovation. He’s also passionate about giving back—he and his wife co-founded Beef Sticks for Backpacks, a nonprofit delivering 20,000 beef sticks weekly to food-insecure kids in Colorado.

**Fun Fact:** Jordan plays in an adult hockey league and is an avid fly fisherman.
