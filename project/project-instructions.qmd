In **Week 2**, you listened to *The Podcase* by Patrick J. McGinnis and John Lafkas (2020), where they interviewed Luke Holden of Luke’s Lobster. You got to hear a real founder reflect on the risks, decisions, and grit it took to build a business.

Now it’s your turn.

This semester, you’ll work in a **pod** of four classmates to create a professional-style podcast episode (a "podcase") featuring a real-world mentor—someone with entrepreneurial experience and insights to share.

> You’ll work in the same group of four students (your pod) for both the podcase and the final business case competition. Each pod will be paired with a [mentor](../mentors/mentors.qmd) based on your preferences, skills, and interests. Think of this as a "mentor match," and you’ll stick with this team throughout the semester.

## Your Assignment

Each pod will be paired with a **mentor**. Your goal is to:

🎤 **Produce a compelling podcast episode** that tells a story about the entrepreneurial journey of your mentor.  
🔍 **Conduct research** to understand their business, sector, and challenges.  
💡 **Craft questions** that go beyond the surface to reveal their thought process, decisions, and values.  
📝 **Write up show notes** to summarize the episode and connect it to themes from the course.

Examples of mentor businesses include:

- An agritech startup solving water access
- A rancher using regenerative grazing models
- A food systems nonprofit improving rural distribution


## What Makes a Great Podcase?

Good podcasts require more than just the technical equipment. To produce a professional-quality episode, you’ll need:

- **Background research** on the mentor and their business
- **Clear structure** for the conversation
- **Engaging co-hosts** with prepared questions
- **Teamwork** to execute your vision

Want inspiration? Explore high-quality podcasts like:

- [The Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/) (known for tight research and clarity)
- [How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/series/490248027/how-i-built-this) (great for founder stories)



## Roles Within Your Pod

Each pod member will take on a defined role:

### 🎬 Pre-Production (Guest Prep)

- Research the mentor’s business and industry
- Help the co-hosts develop interview questions
- Meet with the mentor before the recording to prep them

### 🎙️ Production (Co-Host)

- Co-lead the interview at the CSU Recording Studio
- Drive the conversation and keep it on track
- Reflect curiosity and professionalism throughout

### 🕵️‍♀️ In-Studio Fact Checker

- Sit in on the live session at the CSU Recording Studio
- Look up facts or data to support/clarify what the mentor shares
- Step in with prompts or follow-ups if needed

### ✍️ Post-Production (Show Notes Lead)

- Write engaging and informative show notes
- Highlight important insights, links, and connections to course themes
- Submit your draft to the team and instructor



## Logistics

- **Recording Location:** CSU Library Podcast Studio  
- **Length:** 30-40 minutes  
- **Deadline:** Varies by group – schedule with your mentor and instructor  
- **Submission:** Final show notes uploaded via **Canvas**  


## How You’ll Be Graded

Your podcase will be evaluated based on:

| Criteria         | Points | Description |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Depth of research + prep**    | 25     | Evidence of thoughtful background research, preparation, and familiarity with the mentor’s work and industry. |
| **Interview quality + flow**    | 25     | Questions are clear and engaging; conversation flows naturally and professionally; follow-ups deepen the discussion. |
| **Insightful show notes**       | 25     | Notes accurately summarize the episode, highlight key takeaways, and are clearly written for an external audience. |
| **Team coordination & clarity** | 25     | All team members contribute meaningfully; roles are clear; final product is cohesive and well-organized. |

**Total: 100 points** (10% of final grade)


> The best podcasts don’t just *talk*—they tell a story, highlight decisions, and leave the listener thinking differently. Let’s make something worth sharing.
