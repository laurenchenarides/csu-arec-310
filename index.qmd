## Why This Course Matters

In this course, we're not just studying entrepreneurshipâ€”we're practicing it.

You donâ€™t need to be a startup founder to have an entrepreneurial mindset. Whether you launch your own venture or work within an existing organization, entrepreneurship is about solving problems, creating value, and navigating uncertainty with creativity and resourcefulness.

Weâ€™ll explore both **entrepreneurship** and **intrapreneurship**â€”what it looks like to lead innovation from inside a company, nonprofit, or public agency. These skills are relevant no matter where your career takes you.

### Our Learning Culture

I want you to imagine weâ€™re all part of the same organizationâ€”one where everyoneâ€™s success depends on how well we collaborate, share ideas, and support each otherâ€™s growth. That means:

- We take initiative and hold ourselves accountable.
- We celebrate experimentation and embrace failure as part of the process.
- We give and receive feedback with curiosity and respect.
- We build a culture that reflects the kind of teams weâ€™d want to work on in the real world.

My goal is to help you **connect what you're learning to real decisions and real contexts**. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have experience identifying problems, framing solutions, testing ideas, and communicating your valueâ€”skills you can carry into any industry or role.

Let's build something meaningful together.

*Although this quote is often attributed to Peter Druckerâ€”and occasionally to Abraham Lincolnâ€”there is no reliable evidence linking it to either. The earliest known use is from Dennis Gaborâ€™s 1963 book* *Inventing the Future*, *and it was later popularized by Alan Kay.*
